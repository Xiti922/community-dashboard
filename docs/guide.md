Welcome! You've made it this far, so you are probably the kind of curious sort Terp Network needs. 

Here are some pointers for using github, making your first "pull request". 

## 1. Create A Github Account 
This will be necessary to propose changes & additions to The Dash. 

Simply sign-up and create a profile by following the instructions here.

## 2. Open A Discussion Before Making A Pull Request
lets say you notice a cool fix or have came up with an awesome feature concept. 

To propose this change, you will need to fork the repository, commit your awesome changes, 
and then create a new PR to add your new additions into the main branch.
